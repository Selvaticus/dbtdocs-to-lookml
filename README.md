# [WIP] dbtdocs-to-lookml
A tool to persist descriptions from your dbt project your lookml project.

## To-dos:
For beta release:
- [ ] Make this handle multiple lookml files
- [ ] Parameterize the paths / add a CLI
- [ ] Consider reasonable assumptions around matching a dbt model to a view

Future considerations:
- Should this overwrite files, or just diff them?
- What other command line arguments should it have?
